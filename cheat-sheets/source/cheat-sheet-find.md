# Linux - find
The following commands were collected from several sites. The sources can be found under the headline references. 

## Syntax
Basic syntax of the find command looks like:
```
find <location> <comparison-criteria> <search-term>
```

## Examples

```
find /tmp /etc -name '*.php'
```

Limit depth of directory traversal
```
find . -maxdepth 2 -name '*.php'
```

Invert matches 
```
find . -not -name '*.php'
find . ! -name '*.php'
```

Combine multiple search criterias
```
find . -name 'abc*' ! -name '*.php'
```

or operator
```
find -name '*.php' -o -name '*.txt'
```

To count the number of empty files under current directory, pipe the find command to wc -l.
```
find . -type f -empty | wc -l
```

How many non-empty files are located under the current directory.
```
find . -type f -not -empty | wc -l
```

Delete all files with extension *.aux or *.o
```
find -name "*.aux" -delete 
find -name "*.o" -delete
```

Use the following command to remove all empty directories under the current directory
```
find . -type d -empty -exec rmdir {} \;
```

Delete all matching files or directories. The following command will remove all text files.
```
find . -type f -name "*.txt" -exec rm -f {} \;
```

Delete only files whose name is .DS_Store (Attention: Mac OS-Systems!).
```
find . -type f -name .DS_Store -delete
find . -name ".DS_Store" -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf
```

Use the following command to remove all of those annoying Apple files, but this one also does it recursively through all sub-directories.
```

find . -iname '._*' -exec rm -rf {} \;
```

Find all directories or files whose name is index.php or os-configure. 
```
find / -type d -name os-configure
find / -type f -name index.php
```

Find files with different extensions
```
find . -type f \( -name "*.c" -o -name "*.sh" \)
find . -type f \( -name "*cache" -o -name "*xml" -o -name "*html" \)
```

Find files by text in the file (find + grep)
```
find . -type f -name "*.java" -exec grep -l StringBuffer {} \;    
```

Find files by text in the file (find + grep) and ignore case with -i option.
```
find . -type f -name "*.java" -exec grep -il string {} \;
```

Find files and grep content, 5 lines before, 10 lines after grep matches
```
find . -type f -name "*.php" -exec grep -B5 -A10 'null' {} \;

```
chmod 755 $(find /path/to/base/dir -type d)
chmod 644 $(find /path/to/base/dir -type f)
```
or, to reduce chmod spawning
```
